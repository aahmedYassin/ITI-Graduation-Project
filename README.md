# ITI Graudation Project

This is a sample project that combines both the Spring framework and Angular to create a comprehensive property community platform. It provides users with features for buying, selling, and renting properties. The backend is built with Spring, while the frontend is developed using Angular.

## Features

### Spring Backend

- User Management: The application supports user registration and authentication. Users can create an account, log in using their credentials, and manage their profiles.

- Property Listing: Users can add new properties for sale or rent, providing detailed information such as property type, location, amenities, and pricing. They can also manage their existing property listings.

- Property Search: The application offers search and filtering options for users to find properties based on specific criteria such as location, property type, price range, etc.

- Subscription Management: Users can upgrade their subscription packages, allowing them to add more properties to the platform. The integration with a payment gateway enables secure and seamless subscription upgrades.

### Angular Frontend

- Single Page Application: The frontend is developed using Angular, which allows for a seamless and interactive user experience. The application functions as a single page application, reducing page reloads and enhancing performance.

- Property Exploration: Users can explore a list of properties, search for specific properties, and apply filters based on their preferences.

- User Interface: The Angular frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, with smooth navigation and clear instructions.
